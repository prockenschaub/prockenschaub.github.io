title: "Longitudinal patient stratification of electronic health records with flexible adjustment for clinical outcomes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-11-11-longitudinal-patient-stratification
excerpt: 'The increase in availability of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data is leading to improved understanding of diseases and discovery of novel phenotypes. The majority of clustering algorithms focus only on patient trajectories, yet patients with similar trajectories may have different outcomes. Finding subgroups of patients with different trajectories and outcomes can guide future drug development and improve recruitment to clinical trials. We develop a recurrent neural network autoencoder to cluster EHR data using reconstruction, outcome, and clustering losses which can be weighted to find different types of patient clusters. We show our model is able to discover known clusters from both data biases and outcome differences, outperforming baseline models. We demonstrate the model performance on 29,229 diabetes patients, showing it finds clusters of patients with both different trajectories and different outcomes which can be utilized to aid clinical decision making.'

The increase in availability of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data is leading to improved understanding of diseases and discovery of novel phenotypes. The majority of clustering algorithms focus only on patient trajectories, yet patients with similar trajectories may have different outcomes. Finding subgroups of patients with different trajectories and outcomes can guide future drug development and improve recruitment to clinical trials. We develop a recurrent neural network autoencoder to cluster EHR data using reconstruction, outcome, and clustering losses which can be weighted to find different types of patient clusters. We show our model is able to discover known clusters from both data biases and outcome differences, outperforming baseline models. We demonstrate the model performance on 29,229 diabetes patients, showing it finds clusters of patients with both different trajectories and different outcomes which can be utilized to aid clinical decision making.
