I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Charité Lab for AI in Medicine (CLAIM)](https://claim.charite.de/en/) at the [Charité University Hospital Berlin](https://www.charite.de/en/). I'm additionally affiliated with the [QUEST Center for Responsible Research](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center) at the [Berlin Institute of Health](https://www.bihealth.org/en/). I received a PhD in Health Data Science from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)'s [Institute of Health Informatics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics) in 2021.

My research focus is on creating and deploying predictive models that derive insights from complex healthcare data and help doctor’s make informed decisions. In particular, I am interested in how data heterogeneity and missing data --- both ubiquitous in routine medical data --- impact the performance of such models over time and at new healthcare sites. In my postdoc project, I am specifically looking at the stability of model-based early warning scores in intensive care settings and how approaches such as [invariant learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02893) or [graphical analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11374) may improve said stability.
