My research focus is on creating and deploying predictive models that derive insights from complex healthcare data and help doctorâ€™s make informed decisions. In particular, I am interested in how data heterogenity and missing data --- both ubiquitous in medical data --- impact the performance of such models over time and at new healthcare sites.
